## Creating a Repository on Github
- Initialize a git in the root of the repo you'd like to upload
    git init
- If you have an existing git that you would like to add to, copy and paste into command line
    git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
- Now push the staged changes into github
    git add .
    git push -u origin master

## Inviting collaborators 
- Can be done on the GitHub site instead of command line. 
- YourRepo > Settings > Collaborators

## Pushing/Committing Changes
- Set the stage for your changes:
    git add .
- Push the current repo up into github
    git commit -m "you commit message here"

## Checking out someone else's Repo
- Create a local copy by copying the outside repo's HTTPS
- cd into the working directory you hope to clone into
    git clone https://www.github.com/user/repo.git
